# Netflix Challenge
Side project where I try to build a recommender engine. Data is from the Netflix Prize and can be downloaded from Kaggle (see `data` folder for more information). 

# Goal
The main goal is creating an algorithm to predict user ratings for different movies. 

# Methods
Data was manipulated using Python (Pandas, NumPy) in Jupyter Notebook. Because of the massive size of this dataset, only about half the data was used to build the recommender. 

Once data was processed, the Surprise package was used to predict the ratings given by different users.
